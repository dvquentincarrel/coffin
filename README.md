## Purpose

coffin aims to be yet another codebase lookup tool.  
Works with fixed strings, grep PCRE, can include only some file extensions,
exclude some directories, and has a couple of formatting options (default one can
directly be fed to vim)

## Setting up
Running the `setup.sh` should be enough.  
The installation script links coffin in your `~/.local/bin` dir by default.
You scan specify another directory as an argument like `./setup.sh ~/my_bins`.  
I do not guarantee it will work with names that contain spaces or special characters.
